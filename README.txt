RLCMRS
    The Room and Laboratory Cleanliness and Maintenance Reporting System, or RLCMRS,  is an automated tracking system devised to tackle cleanliness and maintenance challenges 
within PUP Bi√±an's classrooms and laboratories. This innovative solution enables professors and students to report the state of classrooms after use, generating reports 
highlighting areas requiring attention. Through accountability, transparency, and efficiency, it aims to instill responsibility among users, streamline maintenance efforts, 
and prioritize cleaning tasks. 

    It aims to instill a culture of accountability among professors and students, encouraging responsible behavior regarding classroom maintenance. Through transparent 
reporting and efficient task prioritization, the system seeks to enhance overall cleanliness standards, ensuring a conducive and hygienic environment for academic 
activities. Ultimately, its purpose is to promote a seamless learning experience by prioritizing cleanliness and fostering a sense of collective responsibility within the 
university community.
